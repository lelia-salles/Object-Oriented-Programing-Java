## Object-oriented programming (OOP)

OOP is a way of organizing code with ``blueprints`` creating reusable objects that represent real-world things or concepts.

1. **Objects**: things that represent the real world such as persons, products, cars, buttons in a website. They have:

    - **attributes**: characteristics of the object.
    - `**methods**: actions of the object.
2. **Classes**: define the structure and behaviour of an object. Template of an object that can be reusable (instanciated)
3. **Encapsulation**: It keeps data and methods hidden from the outside world. Only the object itself can access it ensuring data integrity.
4. **Inheritance**: Allows the creation of new objects that inherit all the features of a standard object but add some extra features (personalize)
5. **Polimorphism**: objects cand be treated differently depending on their type. Example: a 'print' method can print a name differently than a product description.

**Advantages**

``Reusability``- Reuse objects and classes in different parts of the program, saving time and effort
``Maintainability`` - Organized into logical units making code easier to understand and modify
``Flexibility`` - adaptable to changing requirements
